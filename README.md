### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following tools installed:

- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) - This project requires Python X.X or higher.
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) - You'll need Git to clone the repository and manage version control.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```
    git clone https://github.com/jayeshrajpoot/Hello_World_API/tree/master
```
2. Change the directory to your-name-name
```
    cd your-project-name
```
3. Create the virtual enviroment in your local machine
```
    python -m venv venv
```
4. Activate the virtual environment
```
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```
5. Run the below command to install all the dependencies in your local virtual environment

    <summary>How to use the "Hello World" API</summary>
To use the "Hello World" API, you can use a web browser or a REST client.

To use a web browser, open the following URL in your browser:

http://localhost:5000/hello?language=English

The language parameter should be set to the language of the greeting message you want to receive. For example, to get a greeting message in French, you would use the following URL:

http://localhost:5000/hello?language=French


To use a REST client, you can use the following request:

GET http://localhost:5000/hello?language=English


The response will be a JSON object with the following structure:

{
"message": "Hello world"
}
</details>
2. Open your web browser and go to http://localhost:5000 The page should look like this
